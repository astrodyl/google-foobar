# google-foobar

While searching for memory optimization techniques in C++, I was invited to the Google Foobar challenge. This repo contains my solutions, for better or for worse, through level 4. I have not yet started the final challenge in level 5. Unfortunately, I did not keep track of which challenge corresponded to which level, so they are unorganized.

I hope to come back to these solutions one day to check for improvements and add commentary explaining my thought process.
